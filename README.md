**IPL Auction Strategy Project**
**Overview**
This project aims to develop an auction strategy for a new Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise by analyzing past IPL data to create a strong and balanced squad. The analysis focuses on identifying key players based on their performance metrics, and devising a strategic approach to bid for these players in the auction.

**Background**
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a premier professional Twenty20 cricket league in India, contested annually by eight teams representing different cities or states. Since its inception in 2007 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the IPL has grown to become one of the most-attended and commercially successful cricket leagues in the world.

**Objectives**
Analyze past IPL data to identify players who can add value to the new team.
Develop a balanced squad comprising aggressive batsmen, anchor batsmen, hard-hitters, economical bowlers, and wicket-taking bowlers.
Formulate an auction strategy considering budget constraints and player availability.
Data
The analysis utilizes IPL data from the first season to the 13th season (2020). The dataset includes detailed player statistics such as runs scored, balls faced, wickets taken, and other relevant performance metrics.
